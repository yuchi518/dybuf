# dybuf / dypkt

**dybuf** is a dynamic buffer library that makes binary memory manipulation easy. It supports fixed-width integers, booleans, raw bytes, and compact variable-length encodings so you can focus on protocol logic instead of manual pointer math.

**dypkt** builds upon dybuf to provide a higher-level packet abstraction for structured data handling.

## Projects in this repository

- **C** implementation (stable): [`/c`](c)
- **Python** bindings (published as `dybuf` on PyPI, latest release `0.1.0` and evolving): [`/py`](py)
- **Java** bindings (complete): [`/java`](java)
- **JavaScript** bindings: coming soon
- **Objective-C** bindings: planned

## Roadmap

- Publish the initial JavaScript bindings
- Continue expanding the Python feature set and releases
- Finish Objective-C bindings
- Binary JSON converter
